when trying to implement with existing backend function: some songs don't have neighbors

user searches for song

frontend searching algorithm (breadth/depth):
	
backend generates neighbors for searched song.
backend generates neighbors for every song that is similar to every neighbor
	how so?: for every song, frontend serializes the song into an object with its different attributes, including their neighbors ->parseJSON may handle this already :)

and so, searching algorithm will end when 50/25 songs have been added to queue/list

potential issues:
	generating neighbors for a will send a http request, doing this for many songs might make the process more lengthy
		then again, a limit of 50 won't make it too lengthy :D
	how will the graph (the edges) be drawn?
		the resultant search data will be in the form of a list (of songs)
		a graph edge is defined as (from, to)
			possibly using the same _forEach system?:
				if (nextSong != null)
					makeEdge(thisSong, nextSong)
