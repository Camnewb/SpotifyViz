We have successfully implemented and built a web app that uses:

- A Frontend using HTML, CSS, and JS along with the Bootstrap library
- Both depth-first search and breadth-first search with a visual indication of the process
- A Firebase backend using
  - Firebase Cloud Functions
  - Firebase Hosting
  - Firebase Firestore

## Instructions

- It is recommended to use VS Code with the extension ["Live Server"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and while [frontend/index.html](https://github.com/Camnewb/SpotifyViz/blob/master/frontend/index.html) is open, click "Go Live" in the bottom-right to launch a local web app.
