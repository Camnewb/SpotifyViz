COP3503 Project 3: Graphical visualization of music recommendations

## Working on the website
Using Live Server extension from VS Code, open index.html and hit "Go Live" button
Due to a CORS issue, if you want to recieve data from the server, you must use the google chrome extension Moesif Orign & CORS Changer
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc
When installed, click on the extension icon and turn it on, this will allow the server requests to go through
This extension will cause issues on other sites, so turn if off when you are done
This is a workaround for development, it "shouldnt" be a problem once deployed
